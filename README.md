## About Material 2

The first version of Material was to bring Material Design to iOS. We considered that a great starting point, but not the entire story. Material 2 is the next chapter, which goes deeper into iOS with refined APIs that simplify Architecture, Photo Library, Reminders, Text Editing, Photo & Video, and much more. In addition to Material Design, we love Appleâ€™s flat UI. Having this in mind, we made it possible to accomplish both UI styles with ease.

## Why A Separate Samples Repo?

We moved all sample projects to a separate repo named [Samples](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples) to allow their development to be independent of the Material framework. There has been instances where we needed to update the versions of the framework to accommodate changes that only occurred in the sample projects.
